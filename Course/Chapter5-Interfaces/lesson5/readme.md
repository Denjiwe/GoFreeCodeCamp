# Multiple Interfaces

A type can implement any number of interfaces in Go. For example, the empty interface, `interface{}`, is *always* implemented by every type because it has no requirements.

## Assignment

Complete the required methods so that the email type implements both the expense and formatter interfaces.

### Complete the cost() method:

- If the email is not "subscribed", then the cost is 5 cents for each character in the body.
- If it is, then the cost is 2 cents per character.
- Return the total cost of the entire email in cents.

### Complete the format() method.

- It should return a string in this format:

```'CONTENT' | Subscribed```

- If the email is not subscribed, change the second part to "Not Subscribed":

```CONTENT' | Not Subscribed```

- The single quotes are included in the string, and CONTENT is the email's body. For example:

```'Hello, World!' | Subscribed```
